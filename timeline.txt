-> 8:50 - 9:00
Reads. Get's scared bcz don't know anything about company incentives.
Runs to take breakfast.

-> 9:20 - 9:30
Gonna take a look at the csv files (while eating)
Can already imagine those descriptions of companies being used in a prompt or something
So many things I don't understand in the incentives files
Maybe later I'll use GPT to give me explanations and examples of what you want.

-> 9:30 - 11:00
Gonna tutor someone next door (unrelated, but her mom is paying me to do it so..)

-> 11:00 - 11:15
Creating a git repo to later work on this

-> 11:15 - 12:15
Personal family matters


-> 12:15 - 13:00
Gonna go to the gym while asking deepseek what incentives are, what they mean, and how does that relate to the csv's given.
Eventually I got what incentives are, and what is the purpose of this project.
In my head this is just a matchmaking thing with a chatbot above it.
So basically RAG 101, there may be a twist to it but I'll maybe find out later

-> 13:00 - 13:30
Lunch

-> 13:30 - 14:30
Going to college (by public transportation cuz i have no car), because I have like 3 meetings today, and they like to waste my time by making me phisically going instead of just doing them online.
On my way to college I saw some videos on RAG to refresh my memory on how it works, since the last time I used it was 2 years ago.

-> 14:30 - 17:00
Meetings at college, some giving me more work than the ones I already had, prolly will work on those later
Other meetings was just saying that the meetings will now happen on another day (what a complete waste of time)
I'm going home (probably one more hour or so to come back)

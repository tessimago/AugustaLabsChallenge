-> 8:50 - 9:00
Reads. Get's scared bcz don't know anything about company incentives.
Runs to take breakfast.

-> 9:20 - 9:30
Gonna take a look at the csv files (while eating)
Can already imagine those descriptions of companies being used in a prompt or something
So many things I don't understand in the incentives files
Maybe later I'll use GPT to give me explanations and examples of what you want.

-> 9:30 - 11:00
Gonna tutor someone next door (unrelated, but her mom is paying me to do it so..)

-> 11:00 - 11:15
Creating a git repo to later work on this

-> 11:15 - 12:15
Personal family matters


-> 12:15 - 13:00
Gonna go to the gym while asking deepseek what incentives are, what they mean, and how does that relate to the csv's given.
Eventually I got what incentives are, and what is the purpose of this project.
In my head this is just a matchmaking thing with a chatbot above it.
So basically RAG 101, there may be a twist to it but I'll maybe find out later

-> 13:00 - 13:30
Lunch

-> 13:30 - 14:30
Going to college (by public transportation cuz i have no car), because I have like 3 meetings today, and they like to waste my time by making me phisically going instead of just doing them online.
On my way to college I saw some videos on RAG to refresh my memory on how it works, since the last time I used it was 2 years ago.

-> 14:30 - 17:00
Meetings at college, some giving me more work than the ones I already had, prolly will work on those later
Other meetings was just saying that the meetings will now happen on another day (what a complete waste of time)
I'm going home (probably one more hour or so to come back)

-> 17:00 - 18:30
Finally home, first train was full so had to take another

-> 18:30 - 19:30
Some house chores.. and helping family with stuff...

-> 19:30 - 21:15
Heated my dinner and finally gonna start testing some stuff
20:18 - daam i just found out there are paid embedding models on openai, really thought everyone used bge or some hugging face one with some training or something
I tested some code on RAG to see if I grasp a bit more of that

-> 21:15 - 21:50
Break, because someone called me

-> 21:50 - 00:30
Testing a bit more with RAG and a random PDF
Trying to understand why rag is so bad, is it just bad querys? or bad models? idk.. i'll look into that later
Install postgres to start thinking about how to put this on that database that I haven't used since forever
Maybe procrastinate for 30 minutos on youtube
Make the database they asked about with all the table information and stuff
Maybe or maybe not used deepseek to help me around sql (i never needed to learn postgres in depht, but i can if needed for the job *cof*)
Going to sleep thinking about how will I even make this work, should I save the embedings on postgres? is that even possible? I only used Chroma so far, i guess its another question to deepseek..
I guess the chunks will be easier to separate, no overlap needed as well, hmm.. I have a feeling the rag will do a terrible job and I'll need to improv a better solution or something.

-> 00:30 - 08:30
Sleep
